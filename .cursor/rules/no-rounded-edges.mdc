# No rounded edges (UI)

- **Social graph**: Do not use rounded edges on the social graph. Use `rounded-none` for the graph container, legend card, and any borders (no `rounded`, `rounded-sm`, `rounded-md`, `rounded-lg`, etc.).
- **Cards and borders**: Cards and bordered containers in the app should have no rounded edges; use `rounded-none` for cards and borders.
